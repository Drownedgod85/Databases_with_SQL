### Cyberchase

Welcome to Cyberspace! Cyberchase is an animated, educational kid’s television series, aired by the United States’ Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) since 2002. Originally designed to “show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it,” the world of Cyberchase centers on Jackie, Matt, and Inez as they team up with Digit—a “cybird”—to stop Hacker from taking over Cyberspace and infecting Motherboard. Along the way, the quartet learn math, science, and problem-solving skills to thwart Hacker in his attempts.

In a database called cyberchase.db, using a table called episodes, chase answers to PBS’s questions about Cyberchase’s episodes thus far.
